	<para>The input files to &sid; should be a
		number of input file names dependent upon the output language. The
		first input file is the &sid; grammar file. In the case of
		either C dialects there should be one other input file that provides C
		specific information to &sid;. The number of output files
		is also language specific. At present, two output files should be
		specified for the C languages. The first should be a <code>.c</code>
		file into which the parser is written; the second should be a
		<code>.h</code> file into which the terminal definitions and external
		function declarations are written.</para>

	<para>The options list should consist of zero or more options.
		Rather than duplicate the minutae of the options here, see
		the <citetitle>&sid; manual page</citetitle> for details on
		invocation.</para>

	<para>TODO: explain options have abbreviated names</para>

	<para>TODO: explain that there are language-specific options</para>

	<para>TODO: explain that the number of output files is language-specific</para>

	<para>TODO: give a general form for the above</para>
