	<para>&sid; turns specifications of languages into
		programs that recognise those languages. One of the aims of
		&sid; was to separate the specification of the
		language to be recognised from the language that the recogniser
		program is written in. For this reason, input to &sid;
		is split into two components: output language independent
		information, and output language dependent information.</para>

	<para>At present, &sid; will only output programs in C
		(either &iso; or pre-&iso;), but it is designed so that adding new
		output languages should be fairly simple. Output of the grammar
		to BNF is also provided. There is one other pseudo-language:
		the test language. This is used for testing grammars and the
		transforms, but will not output a parser.</para>

	<para>This document describes how to use the &sid; parser
		generator.
		A little background on grammars is given, and how to write grammars
		suitable for use with SID. The interfaces for the generated code which
		SID produces are specified. A tour of SID's more interesting features
		is given, and some guiding advice for general use.</para>
