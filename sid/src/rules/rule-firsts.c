/*
 * rule-firsts.c - Computation of rule first sets.
 *
 * This file implements the SID first set calculation routines.
 *
 * The first set of a rule is the set of all terminals that may start that
 * rule.  As well as computing the first set of a rule, its priority and
 * whether or not it is see through are also computed.  A rule is see through
 * if there is an expansion of the rule that does not involve a basic or
 * predicate.  The priority is used during the factorisation phase to work out
 * which rules to expand.  The rule's priority is one more than the priority
 * of the rule with the highest priority in any of the rule's alternatives
 * that is not preceded by an action.  If there is no such rule, then the
 * rule's priority is one.
 *
 * As well as computing the first sets, these routines check that there are no
 * recursive calls that are not preceded by a basic or predicate.  They also
 * check that predicates are either the first item in an alternative, or are
 * preceded by a basic (or another predicate).  The same check is also made
 * for rules that start with a predicate.
