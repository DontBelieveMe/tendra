/*
 * This function applies several functions from the file "rule.c" to the rules
 * in the grammar, to detect left cycles (this is done by the
 * "grammar_find_cycles" function).  When such a cycle is found, it calls
 * rule_remove_left_cycle() (defined in the file "rule-lre.c") to remove the
 * cycle.  The function removes any left recursion from the rules, replacing
 * it with a right recursive equivalent.  See the file "rule-lre.c" for more
 * details.
 *
 * The cycle detection algorithm works as follows: firstly a list of rules is
 * built by the function()`rule_build_root_list(); this list acts as the root
 * node of the graph.  The remainder of the graph is built up from the
 * leftmost rule invocations (if any) in each alternative of each production.
 * This graph is depth first searched by the function ``rule_compute_dfs'', to
 * produce an ordered list of productions.  The reverse graph (which is
 * computed by applying the function ``rule_compute_reverse_list'' to each
 * production, at the same time as the dfs is being performed) is then depth
 * first searched in the order specified by the list, using the function
 * rule_compute_reverse_dfs().  The result of this is the set of left
 * cycles.  The algorithm is explained fully in {"Data Structures and
 * Algorithms"; Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman; Addison Wesley; ISBN 0-201-00023-7;
 * page 222}.
