Shared Support Functions
------------------------

This project consists of various support functions shared across several TenDRA
projects. These are not considered worth releasing as a library in their own
right, either because they are trivially small, or because they are specific to
TenDRA.

The intention is that they are included into the source tree of each project by
way of symbolic links within the repository. In this way the code is
centralised without depending on a separate library, and those links are folded
in locally when taring up single projects for release.

Each set of support functions is grouped into a statically-linked archive.
These archives take the role of miniature libraries, save that their APIs are
not particularly tidy, and are subject to change. check.h is a slightly
exception, since it provides only a header.
