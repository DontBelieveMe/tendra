Shared Support Functions
------------------------

This project consists of various support functions shared across several TenDRA
projects. These are not considered worth releasing as a library in their own
right, either because they are trvially small, or because they are specific to
TenDRA.

The intention is that they are includes into the source tree of each project by
way of svn:externals references. In this way the code is centralised without
depending on a seperate library.

Each set of support functions is grouped into a statically-linked archive.
These archives take the role of minature libraries, save that their APIs are
not particularly tidy, and are subject to change.
