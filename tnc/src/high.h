    TYPE REPRESENTING HIGH LEVEL SORTS

    A high level sort consists of a name and a dummy sort number, id.
    These are associated with a sort number, giving the result sort,
    and an array of sort numbers, giving the argument sorts.

    STARTING POINT FOR HIGH LEVEL SORTS

    To distinguish them from the normal TDF sorts, high level sorts
    are assigned sort numbers starting at high_start.  The macro
    is_high is used to test whether a sort number corresponds to a
    high level sort, and high_no is used to transform a high level
    sort number into an offset in the table high_sorts.
