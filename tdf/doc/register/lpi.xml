	<title>Language Programming Interfaces</title>

	<para>A Language Programming Interface (&lpi;) is here defined to mean a set
		of tokens, usually specific to a particular producer, which will encapsulate
		language features at a higher level than basic &tdf; constructs, more
		convenient for the producer to produce.</para>

	<para>Responsibility for the specification of individual &lpi;s lies with
		the appropriate producer itself. Before an application can be installed
		on some target platform, the appropriate &lpi; token definitions must
		have been built for that platform. In this sense, the &lpi; can be considered
		as a primitive &api;, which is discussed in <xref linkend="apis"/>.</para>

	<para>The process by which the &lpi; token definition library or capsule is
		generated for any specific platform will vary according to the &lpi;,
		and responsibility for defining that process will also lie with the
		appropriate producer. Some &lpi;s, such as that associated with <acronym>DRA</acronym>'s
		C producer, can be fully defined by architecture neutral &tdf;, using
		the tokens specified in <xref linkend="targetdep"/> and <xref linkend="basicmappingtoks"/>
		to encapsulate any target dependencies. When that is the case, the
		generation process can be fully automated. For other &lpi;s the process
		may be much less automated. In some cases where the source language
		implies a complex run-time system, this might even require a small
		amount of new code to be written for each platform.</para>

	<para>Generally, the individual &lpi; tokens do not need to be specified in
		the token registry, provided they follow a registered naming scheme
		to ensure uniqueness (see <xref linkend="namingscheme"/>). In exceptional
		circumstances it may be necessary for some &tdf; tool to recognise individual
		&lpi; tokens explicitly by name. This will be the case when experimenting
		with potential extensions to &tdf;, in the field of parallelism for
		example. In other cases a &tdf; installer or other tool may recognise
		an &lpi; token by name rather than its definition by choice, for some
		unspecified advantage. We make a pragmatic choice in such cases whether
		to include such token specifications in the token registry. For widely
		used producers, we can assume availability of the &lpi; token specifcations,
		or standard definitions, separately from the token register, but we
		should expect any such tokens to be specified within the register
		for all cases where significant advantage could be taken by an installer
		only if it recognises the token by name.</para>

	<section>
		<title>The <acronym>DRA</acronym> C &lpi;</title>

		<para><acronym>DRA</acronym>'s C producer &lpi; is defined by an architecture neutral token definition
			capsule provided with the producer. Target specific detail is included
			only by use of the target dependency tokens and C mapping tokens specified
			in <xref linkend="targetdep"/> and <xref linkend="cmappingtoks"/> respectively.
			Target specific versions of this capsule are obtained by transformation,
			using the preprocessing action of the &tdf; tool <code>tnc</code>, with
			definitions of the target dependency and C mapping tokens that are
			provided with the target installer. No special treatment is required
			for any of the C &lpi; tokens, though translation time can be slightly
			improved in a few cases if the names are recognised and standard token
			definition exercised explicitly within some installers.</para>

		<para>The <acronym>DRA</acronym> C &lpi; does not include standard library features, for which
			the C language requires header files. The standard C library is one
			example of an &api;, discussed in <xref linkend="apis"/>.</para>

		<title>The <acronym>DRA</acronym> C++ &lpi;</title>

		<para>The <acronym>DRA</acronym> C++ &lpi; extends the <acronym>DRA</acronym> C &lpi; adding tokens for target specific
			C++ features not found in C.  Again, standard library features are
			treated as an &api;.</para>

		<para>The details in this subsection are provisional, subject to confirmation
			of argument and result <code>SORT</code>s, and development of model
			token definitions.</para>

		<para>The following tokens are named here in case any installers may be
			able to produce better code than could be achieved by normal token
			expansion. In particular, some installers may be able to inline standard
			function calls.</para>
