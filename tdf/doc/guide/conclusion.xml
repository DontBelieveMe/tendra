	<title>Conclusion</title>

	<para>This commentary is not complete. I have tended to go into
		considerable detail into aspects which I consider might be unfamiliar
		and skip over others which occur in most compiling systems. I also
		have a tendency to say things more than once, albeit in different
		words; however if something is worth saying, it is worth saying
		twice.</para>
