	<para>PL_TDF is a language in the lineage of Wirth's PL360 and its later
		derivatives. The basic idea in PL360 was to give one an assembler in
		which one could express all of the order-code of the IBM 360 while
		still preserving the logical structure of the program using familiar
		programming constructs. If one had to produce a program at the code
		level, this approach was much preferable to writing <quote>flat</quote>
		assembly code using a traditional assembler, as anyone who has used
		both can testify.</para>

	<para>In the TDF <quote>machine</quote> the problem is not lack of structure at its
		<quote>assembly</quote> level, but rather too much of it; one loses the sense of a
		TDF program because of its deeply nested structure.  Also the naming
		conventions of TDF are designed to make them tractable to machine
		manipulation, rather than human reading and writing. However, the
		approach is basically the same. PL_TDF provides shorthand notations
		for the commonly occuring control structures and operations while
		still allowing one to use the standard TDF constructors which, in
		turn, may have shorthand notations for their parameters. The naming is
		always done by identifiers where the sort of the name is determined by
		its declaration, or by context.</para>

	<para>The TDF derived from PL_TDF is guaranteed to be SORT correct;
		however, there is no SHAPE checking, so one can still make illegal
		TDF.</para>
