determines whether the exp e can fit in a single fixed point register. Uses
macros isvis, isglob, iscaonly from expmacs.h which examine the props
field. The iscaonly bit is set by proc independent if the tag is only used
by the contents operator or as the left hand side of an assignment. The
procedure also uses the macro is_floating from shapemacs.h which checks
the shape number is in the range for floating point shapes.
