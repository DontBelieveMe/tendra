/********************************************************************
The following types store the symbolic information for each table
in the .T file. They consist of a count of the number of elements
(num,noofsyms) or size (usage) in the case of strings. This is followed
by a pointer to a fixed number of elements of the appropriate type . The
size of this space is given by the appropriate macro at the end of this file.
Consequently, when the number of elements in the table exceeds this fixed size
a new array is set up and pointed to by the nextsyms or overspill field.
This mechanism is transparent to the caller of the symbol table routines
given in new_symbol.c
