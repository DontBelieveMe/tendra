SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT THE HP-PA INSTALLER
======================================

The "hpux/hppa" installer as shipped is not capable of producing the
normal HP diagnostic output (so programs compiled with "tcc -g" will not
contain debugging information).  The file "hpux-symtab.h" is needed to
enable these diagnostics.  This file is not included with the release as it
is covered by the GPL, but is obtainable at:

	ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu:/dist/hpux-symtab.h

To enable the diagnostic output, put a copy of this file in the directory
"src/installers/hppa/hpux", edit the file "config.h" in this same directory
to add the line:

	#define _SYMTAB_INCLUDED		1

and perform a full install.
