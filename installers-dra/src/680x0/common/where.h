    STRUCTURE REPRESENTING ALLOCATED EXPRESSIONS

    A where consists of an expression, wh_exp, and an offset wh_off.
    The wh_is field gives information on where the expression is
    stored (see below).  The wh_regs field gives the register mask
    of all the registers involved in storing the expression.
