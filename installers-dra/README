DRA TDF Installers
------------------

installers-dra contains the compiler back-ends, which translate the compiler
intermediate form, TDF, to the appropriate machine instructions.
See <http://www.tendra.org/> for details.


Structure
---------

The installers directory is split into a common section, containing code
which is used by all the back ends, plus a directory for each of the
target CPUs:

    680x0           Motorola 68020, 68030 and 68040,
    80x86           Intel i386, i486 and Pentium,
    alpha           DEC Alpha,
    hppa            HP Precision Architecture,
    mips            SGI/DEC MIPS,
    power           POWER,
    ppc601          POWER PC,
    sparc           SPARC.

Each CPU directory is also divided into a common section, plus a directory
for each of the target operating systems:

    680x0/sunos     680x0 on SunOS 4,
    80x86/dragonfly Intel on DragonFly,
    80x86/freebsd   Intel on FreeBSD,
    80x86/linux     Intel on Linux,
    80x86/netbsd    Intel on NetBSD,
    80x86/openbsd   Intel on OpenBSD,
    80x86/solaris   Intel on Solaris 2,
    alpha/osf1      Alpha on OSF/1,
    hppa/hpux       HP-PA on HP-UX,
    mips/irix       MIPS on Irix,
    mips/ultrix     MIPS on Ultrix,
    power/aix       POWER on AIX,
    ppc601/aix      POWER PC on AIX,
    sparc/solaris   SPARC on Solaris 2,
    sparc/sunos     SPARC on SunOS 4.

The common installer directory is also subdivided, for convenience, into
a number of different subdirectories:

    construct   which contains the main routines for transforming
                and optimising the internal representation;

    diag        which contains routines for reading and processing
                diagnostic information contained within the TDF;

    dwarf       which contains routines for writing out diagnostic
                information as DWARF directives;

    dwarf2      which contains routines for writing out diagnostic
                information as DWARF 2 directives;

    linkinfo    which contains routines for reading linkage
                information contained within the TDF;

    reader      which contains the main routine for reading the
                input TDF and building up the internal representation;

    templ       which contains template files used to generate
                the TDF reading routines.
