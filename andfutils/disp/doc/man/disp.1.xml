		<para><command>disp</command> translates the input
			<acronym>TDF</acronym> capsule,
			<emphasis remap='I'>input-file</emphasis> into a
			human-readable form, the layout of which reflects the
			structure of the underlying <acronym>TDF</acronym> tree.
			If the <emphasis remap='I'>output-file</emphasis> argument
			is present, this is used for output; otherwise the
			standard output is used.</para>

		<para>Whenever possible the output of <command>disp</command>
			matches the <acronym>TDF</acronym> specification.
			The most important exception is the use of asterisks after
			a token name to indicate an application of that token.
			Also a dash is used to indicate the absense of an optional
			argument and an ellipsis (...) is used to indicate that a
			token's arguments have been skipped rather than decoded
			(since the token was undeclared).</para>

		<para>It is recommended that <command>disp</command> is
			invoked via <command>tcc</command> using the
			<option>-disp</option> or the <option>-disp_t</option>
			option.  The <option>-opt</option> flag can
			be passed to <command>disp</command> by passing the flag
			<option>-Wd,-</option><replaceable>opt</replaceable> to
			<command>tcc</command>.</para>

				<listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>Because tokens may be defined in terms of
						other tokens and do not need to be declared
						before they are defined, <command>disp</command>
						makes two passes of all the token definition units.
						In the first pass it extracts only the
						declaration information, stepping over the main
						body of the definition.  On the second pass all
						the information is read.  The <option>-S</option>
						option makes <command>disp</command> skip the
						first pass.</para>

				<term><option>-V</option></term>

				<listitem>
					<para>By default <command>disp</command> attempts
						to rationalise the <acronym>TDF</acronym> it reads.  In
						particular it uses the external token and tag
						names whenever possible, following the token
						and tag bindings to find these, and makes up
						names for those tokens and tags which do not
						have external names.  The <option>-V</option>
						option makes it not attempt any such
						rationalisation, but instead to output exactly
						what it reads.</para>
				</listitem>
