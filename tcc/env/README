TCC ENVIRONMENTS
================

This directory contains the tcc environments; the files which are used
to configure the driver program tcc for a particular platform.  It is
organised into subdirectories as follows:

	common
	<os>/common/common
	<os>/common/<cpu>
	<os>/<exec>/common
	<os>/<exec>/<cpu>
	<os>/<version>/common
	<os>/<version>/<cpu>

for each operating system <os>, operating system executable format <exec>,
operating system version <version>, and processor type <cpu>.  These are
listed from most generic to most target specific.  A more target specific
version of a given environment always overrides a more generic version.

Each environment is run through a simple sed script as it is installed
which replaces certain placeholders by their value on the target machine.
These placeholders are:

    -MACH-		for the machine type '<os>/<cpu>',
    -MACHDIR-		for the private machine directory,
    -BINDIR-		for the private executable directory,
    -ENVDIR-		for the private environment directory,
    -LIBDIR-		for the private library directory,
    -INCLDIR-		for the public include file directory,
    -STARTUPDIR-	for the public start-up file directory,
    -TMPDIR-		for the temporary directory.
