	<title>The Function of &tcc;</title>

	<para>Like most compilation systems, the &tdf; C system consists of a
		number of components which transform or combine various types
		of input files into output files.
		&tcc; is designed to be a compilation manager, coordinating
		these various components into a coherent compilation scheme.
		It is also the normal user's interface to the &tdf; system on
		Unix machines: direct use of the various components of the
		system is not recommended.
		Therefore it is worth familiarising oneself with &tcc; before
		attempting to use the &tdf; system.
		To aid this familiarisation &tcc; has been designed to have the
		same look and feel as the system C compiler &cc;, but with added
		functionality to deal with the additional features of the &tdf;
		system.
		This does not mean that &tcc; can be necessarily regarded
		as a direct replacement for &cc;; the extra portability
		checks performed by the &tdf; system require the precise
		compilation environment to be specified to &tcc; in a way that
		it cannot be to &cc;.</para>

	<para>There are two basic components to this paper.
		The first describes the &tdf; compilation strategy and how it is
		implemented by &tcc;.
		The second is a Quick Reference section at the end of the paper,
		which is intended to be a &tcc; user's manual.
		For even quicker reference, &tcc; will print a list of all its
		command-line options (with a brief description) if invoked with
		the <userinput>-query</userinput> option.</para>
