		A guide to the process of porting to a new operating system.

		This should be a fairly straightforward guide; for the moment
		we can leave out writing new installers, and just concentrate
		on the build system.

		Unless there are things I'm unaware of, this is as
		straightforward as simply editing tbe makedefs file, and
		letting bmake take care of all the platform-specific things?

		So this should probably just talk about that, and explain what
		each field is, and why it's required.
