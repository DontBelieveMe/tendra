Acknowledging Patches
=====================

Regardless as to whether a patch is appropriate or not, it seems that
people have in the past submitted things which simply went ignored.

These have been really simple things - see #68 for example.

If people are ignored, they lose interest, and go elsewhere.

Possibly we could have some sort of "incoming patches" list, as I
believe PostgreSQL do, just to make sure they aren't missed. A quick
"thank you, we'll get around to it when we have a moment" is all it
takes.

This may seem kind of obvious, but I'd like it recorded anyway,
especially from the marketing perspective - see the newdevelopers
document.
