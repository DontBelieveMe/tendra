Features
========

This document will eventually become (or be merged into) a "todo" list
for TenDRA. This lists both new features to be added, and existing
features to be enhanced.

Each item here is expected to be relatively large (to the order of
adding support for a new architecture, for example), and may consist
of several tickets.

See the projects document for side-projects which are not direct
features of TenDRA.


AMD64 Installers
----------------

Currently the AMD64 installers are mostly copies of the 80x86
installers. This means we don't have support for generating assembler
code for the AMD64 Instruction Set Architecture.
