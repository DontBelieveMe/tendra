	<title>TenDRA Glossary</title>

	<para>
		A glossary of major terms and concepts used by The TenDRA Project.
	</para>

	<!--
		Certainly all acronyms should be here, especially those used for
		file extensions and other highly visible things.

		Perhaps more importantly, this document is to be a reference for
		the obscure terms which need clarifying. These are most often only
		visible to developers who have nothing but the source code, if
		something is unclear - and the source currently isn't very helpful
		in description.

		Be careful not to let this become an index of software. Is it
		really appropriate to add entries for things like yacc? Or if we
		do, keep them separate (as for CPUs, etc). Perhaps we should remove
		CPUs and such.
