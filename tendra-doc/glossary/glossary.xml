	<para>
		A glossary of major terms and concepts used by The TenDRA Project.

	<!--
		Certinaly all acronyms should be here, especially those used for
		file extensions and other highly visible things.

		Perhaps more importantly, this document is to be a reference for
		the obscure terms which need clarifying. These are most often only
		visible to developers who have nothing but the source code, if
		something is unclear - and the source currently isn't very helpful
		in description.
