Developer Guides
================

Guides for developers who've started work on TenDRA.

These are orientation guides, to help prevent someone from feeling lost,
or unsure about how their efforts integrate into the repository.

These are not reference materials; the provide context for the
reference documentation.


Adding new APIs
---------------

Adding new APIs is rather daunting for a couple of reasons:

 * They can be huge
 * Figuring out which bits inherit from existing APIs is confusing
 * It's unlikely that tspec is familiar

This guide should introduce the process involved; how to go about the
whole thing, what things should inherit from where and why, and how to
perform testing.
