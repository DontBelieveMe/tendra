	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>This memo is intended to be a fairly detailed commentary on the
		specification of TDF, a kind of Talmud to the Torah. If it conflicts
		with the specification document, it is wrong. The aim is elucidate the
		various constructions of TDF, giving examples of usages both from the
		point of view of a producer of TDF and how it is used to construct
		programs on particular platforms using various installers or
		translators. In addition, some attempt is made to give the reasons why
		the particular constructions have been chosen. Most of the commentary is
		a distillation of questions and answers raised by people trying to learn
		TDF from the specification document.</para>

	<para>Throughout this document, references like (S5.1) are headings in the
		&tdf-spec.doc;.
		I use the term "compiling" or "producing" to mean the production of TDF
		from some source language and "translating" to mean making a program for
		some specific platform from TDF.</para>

	<para>I use the first person where I am expressing my own opinions or
		preferences; these should not be taken as official opinions of DRA or
		the TenDRA team.</para>
