 * syntax.h - Character classification.

 * This file specifies the interface to a number of syntax table manipulation
 * functions.  I ought to be able to use <ctype.h> for this, but I can't
 * because it doesn't have routines to get the numeric value for alphabetic
 * characters (amongst other omissions).
 *
 * It is assumed elsewhere (in association with the input stream facility
 * specified in the file "istream.h") that the null and newline characters are
 * white space, and have no digit value.
