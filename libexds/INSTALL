Installing libexds
------------------

Installing libexds should go smoothly with:

% make PREFIX=/usr/local install

which should automatically compile and install libexds
under the given prefix. Other targets provided are "all"
for which the prefix should also be specified, "clean",
and "test".

Platform-specific options may be given by overriding the
various makefile variables. See the Makefile for details
of these. For example, to compile with TenDRA:

% make CC=tcc CFLAGS='-Ysystem -Xs -I ../include'


Dependencies required:

The makefiles should be portable; they have been tested with
NetBSD's make and with GNU make.

A little use is made of C99; more will follow in the future.
