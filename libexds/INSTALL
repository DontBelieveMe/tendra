Installing libexds
------------------

Installing libexds should go smoothly with simply:

% make PREFIX=/usr/local install

which should automatically compile and install libexds
under the given prefix. Other targets provided are "all"
for which the prefix should also be specified, "clean",
and "test".


Dependencies required:

 * libtool, for portably building libraries

The makefiles should be portable; they have been tested with
NetBSD's make and with GNU make.

A little use is made of C99; more will follow in the future.
