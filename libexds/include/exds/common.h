 * common.h - Primitive definitions common to several interfaces.
 *
 * This file specifies an interface to the host system's C library, compiler
 * and operating system.  It provides definitions of basic types, constants
 * and macros, and declarations of functions, that can be used by other
 * components of programs.
 *
 * This file used to provide portability abstractions; now all that remains
 * are definitions for semantic purposes, such as CmpT.
 *
 * This is seperate from exception.h as some APIs provided by the library
 * may not neccessary make use of the exception mechanism (for example, a
 * memory pool allocation system). However, that would be built upon to
 * provide an exception-throwing interface as an additional layer.
 *
 * Any compiler-specific or standard-specific features should be in this file.
