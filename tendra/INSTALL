This INSTALL document is here only for those who are trying out a SNAP or CVS
release.

Configuring TenDRA is very easy, typing 'bmake' will get you a list of
configurable targets, select one of these targets to create your corresponding
config.mk.  For instance, if you're on FreeBSD, 'bmake freebsd' will get you
going.


Note: Even though TenDRA uses PMake, if you have an error please try with our
      shipped PMake, the *BSD's have extended make to support features that are
      not supported by us, sometimes breakage can happen.

You can edit config.mk to your liking, please be mindful of changes you've made
to config.mk, periodically you'll need to regenerate this to pull in supported
variables and features.
