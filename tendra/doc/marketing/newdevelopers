Resources for New Developers
============================

When introducing TenDRA to developers who're interested in TenDRA, I
find myself repeating explanations of various things. These are, roughly:

 * A quick overview of what TenDRA is, who made it, and why
 * How it differs from other projects in implementation
 * How it differs in goals and mentality (this is vital to convey if we want
   to attract new developers! - less important for users)
 * Our future plans
 * What each component is for
 * What state the project is in, and why it's not usable (this is two
   parts: refactoring and obsolescence)

The "how it differs" part requires some conceptual orientation;
explaining about making the IR accessible (as TDF), for example, and
the repercussions that has.

As for components, we would benefit from documentation giving overviews
of each, and what they're for. An orienting overview of how they fit
together would also help.

Components that spring to mind:

 * ANDF and TDF
 * tspec and the abstract APIs (now that would be a good band title)
 * Error message reporting. Everybody loves this!
 * lexi and sid: in particular, sid's LR -> LL approach

The emphasis here is on introducing new concepts, rather than explaining
details of how they're used (that reference detail can be in usage
guides instead).
