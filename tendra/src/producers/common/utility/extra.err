    EXTRA ERRORS

    These errors are additional to those in errors.err.  It is intended
    that this file is to be used during development to add extra errors
    without having to compile the entire program.  They can then be moved
    to errors.err at some suitable juncture.  In order to access these
    errors from a source file, include extra.h before catalog.h.
