/*
  Allocation of register weights

  The main procedure here is weightsv which determines the allocation
  of s-registers.  It considers which of those tags not already 
  allocated to a t-register by scan are best put in an s-register.  
  The same conditions as for t-registers apply as to the suitability
  of the tags for registers.  Weights estimates the usage of each 
  tag and hence the amount that would be saved if it were held in an
  s-register.  Thus it computes break points for register allocation
  for later use by reg_alloc.
  The type weights consists of two arrays of integers.  In the first
  array each integer corresponds to a fixed point register and the 
  second array's integers correspond to floating point registerss.  
  At the end of a call of weights on an ident exp the props field of
  the ident may still contain inreg_bits or infreg_bits, set by scan,
  to indicate that a t-register should be used.  Otherwise number of 
  ident is set up to represent the break point for allocation.  A 
  similar process occurs for procedure parameters which have the 
  break value in the forweights field of the parapair of the 
  corresponding procrec. This value has three meanings :

  1) The ident (or parameter) defines a fixed point value and 
     number of ident (forweights of parpair) is an integer brk with 
     the interpretation that if there are at least brk fixed point 
     s-registers unallocated at this point then one will be used for
     this tag (parameter).

  2) As 1 but for floating point values.

  3) number of ident = 100 in which case allocate value on the 
     stack,(this is obviously always available for parameters).

  CALCULATE A BREAKPOINT

  loc is the usage count of a tag, ws is the weights computed for the
  scope of the tag and fix distinguishes between fix and float.  This
  routine computes the weights for the declaration and a break point
  for register allocation which gives the number of available regs 
  for which it is worthwhile to allocate this tag into a reg 
  ("regged").
  This procedure is the source of all non-zero weights.  loc may be
  negative since using a s-reg will involve a dump and restore.
