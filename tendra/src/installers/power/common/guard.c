		 guard.c

	These routines protect registers from future use. The type
involved is space which consists of two long ints with bit patterns
taken to represent usage of temporary fixed and floating
point registers. These bits are used in the procedure
getregs which understands a clear bit to mean that the corresponding
register is free for use.
	The procedures are widely used in make_code which may use
getreg to choose a register to contain the result of an expression.
If this expression is the first operand of a binary operation (say) then the register
is guarded, producing another space which will be used by make_code for the
second operand.

The integer parameter to procedures guardreg and guardfreg

registers a factor of 2 is involved. The corresponding bit in the appropriate field of the

instore value. These types are defined in addresstypes.h.
