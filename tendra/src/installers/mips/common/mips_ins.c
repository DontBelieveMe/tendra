 *This file defines the MIPS instruction set as C strings for use by assembler
 *producing routines such as make_code.
 *Each MIPS instruction is a unique string starting with  i_ using MIPS
 * names  with . replaced by _
 *The first character of each string is  (binasm coding +1) for the instruction
