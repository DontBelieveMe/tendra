short symtype ... symbol type as given in sym.h

short symclass ... symbol class as given in sym.h

type s ... typeof the symbol (except for stFile, stEnd etc) - this is
converted to an AUXU which is added to the auxillary table. Structs and
unions must correspond to a type previously entered in the symbol table
which can be found by find_aux. Bitfields are negative shapes with
size = abs and btUInt in auxillary table. For a symtype stProc or
stStaticProc this shape should be the return type.

long filenum ... index for the file
