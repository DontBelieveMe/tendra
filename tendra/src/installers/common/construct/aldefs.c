/* The alignment definitions form a set of simultaneous equations
   of the form

     a1 = f1(a1,a2 .. an)
     a2 = f2(a1,a2 ... an)
     ...

   The functions f1 f2 etc. are formed entirely from f_alignment,
   which takes a shape and delivers an alignment, and unite_sets.
   f_alignment provides constants. Since the representation of
   alignments must be a homomorphism of sets under unite_sets, and
   since any program contains a finite number of basic alignments,
   these equations can be solved by iterating unite_sets until
   no further change occurs. Unite_sets is represented here by max.
