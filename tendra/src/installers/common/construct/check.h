                              checkdecs.h

  The routine check performs the bottom-up TDF-to-TDF optimising
  transformations. When a new exp is created check is applied to
  see if a recognised situation has arisen. check assumes that
  all components of this new exp have already had check applied to them.
  It returns 1 if it has made a change, 0 if not.


  hold_check holds an exp as the son of a dummy exp and then 
  applies check. the need for this operation is explained in
  the overall documentation.

  eq_exp compares two exp for equality of effect. 

  dochvar takes the int, i, and delivers the number which results from
  changing its variety to that specified by the shape, t.
