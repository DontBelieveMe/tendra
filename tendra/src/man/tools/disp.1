.SH "NAME" 
.PP 
\fBdisp\fP - TDF pretty printer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBdisp\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIinput-file\fP  [\fIoutput-file\fP] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdisp\fP translates the input TDF capsule, \fIinput-file\fP into a human-readable form, the layout of
which reflects the structure of the underlying TDF tree\&. If the \fIoutput-file\fP argument is present, this is used for
output; otherwise the standard output is used\&.
.PP
Whenever possible the output of \fBdisp\fP matches the
TDF specification\&. The most important exception is the use of asterisks
after a token name to indicate an application of that token\&. Also a dash
is used to indicate the absense of an optional argument and an ellipsis
(\&.\&.\&.) is used to indicate that a token\&'s arguments have been skipped
rather than decoded (since the token was undeclared)\&.
.PP
It is recommended that \fBdisp\fP is invoked via
\fBtcc\fP\fB(1)\fP using the \fB-disp\fP or the
\fB-disp_t\fP option\&. The \fI-\fP\fIopt\fP flag can be passed to
\fBdisp\fP by passing the flag
\fB-Wd,-\fP\fIopt\fP to
\fItcc\fP\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-A\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP decode all the units it
recognises (including diagnostic and linking units) within the TDF
capsule\&.
.IP "\fB-D\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP print a simple binary dump of
the input file\&. This is intended for debugging purposes\&.
.IP "\fB-E\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP report such information as the
number of external tags and tokens which it usually omits\&.
.IP "\fB-S\fP" 5
Because tokens may be defined in terms of other tokens and do
not need to be declared before they are defined,
\fBdisp\fP makes two passes of all the token
definition units\&. In the first pass it extracts only the
declaration information, stepping over the main body of the
definition\&. On the second pass all the information is read\&. The
\fB-S\fP option makes \fBdisp\fP skip the
first pass\&.
.IP "\fB-T\fP" 5
The skip pass described under the \fB-S\fP option
is usual done silently, without printing any information\&. This is
changed by the \fB-T\fP option\&.
.IP "\fB-V\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP print its version number and
the version of the TDF specification it supports\&.
.IP "\fB-W\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP issue a warning about every
token which is used before it is declared\&.
.IP "\fB-a\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-d\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-g\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP print any diagnostic
information units within the TDF capsule\&.
.IP "\fB-i\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-l\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP print the usage information
associated with the external tokens and tags and also any
linkage information units within the capsule\&.
.IP "\fB-n\fP\fIcolumns\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP try to format its output to fit
into a page width of \fIcolumns\fP\&. The
default page width is 80\&.
.IP "\fB-q\fP" 5
Makes \fBdisp\fP ignore the specified page width
and print its output with the minimum possible indentation\&. This
makes it run faster, but does not make the best use of the
available page width\&.
.IP "\fB-r\fP" 5
By default \fBdisp\fP attempts to rationalise
the TDF it reads\&. In particular it uses the external token and tag
names whenever possible, following the token and tag bindings to
find these, and makes up names for those tokens and tags which
do not have external names\&. The \fB-V\fP option
makes it not attempt any such rationalisation, but instead to output
exactly what it reads\&.
.IP "\fB-v\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-x\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
The error reports if the input file is not a legal TDF capsule are
intended to aid developers writing programs which produce TDF\&. Thus they
try to give all the information that may be required, including the
position within the input file that the error occurred\&.
