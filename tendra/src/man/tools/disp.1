.SH NAME
disp \- TDF pretty printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdisp\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIinput-file\fR [ \fIoutput-file\fR ]
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdisp\fR translates the input TDF capsule, \fIinput-file\fR into a
human-readable form, the layout of which reflects the structure of the
underlying TDF tree.  If the \fIoutput-file\fR argument is present, this
is used for output; otherwise the standard output is used.
.PP
Whenever possible the output of \fBdisp\fR matches the TDF specification.
The most important exception is the use of asterisks after a token
name to indicate an application of that token.  Also a dash is used to
indicate the absense of an optional argument and an ellipsis (...) is used
to indicate that a token's arguments have been skipped rather than decoded
(since the token was undeclared).
.PP
It is recommended that \fBdisp\fR is invoked via \fItcc\fR(1) using
the \fB-disp\fR or the \fB-disp_t\fR option.  The \fB-\fIopt\fR flag can
be passed to \fBdisp\fR by passing the flag \fB-Wd,-\fIopt\fR to \fItcc\fR.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-g\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR print any diagnostic information units within the
TDF capsule.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-n\fIcolumns\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR try to format its output to fit into a page width
of \fIcolumns\fR.  The default page width is 80.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-q\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR ignore the specified page width and print its output
with the minimum possible indentation.  This makes it run faster, but
does not make the best use of the available page width.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-r\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR continue after any errors.  The use of this flag is
not recommended since anything read after an error is likely to be of
very little value.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-v\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR print its version number and the version of the TDF
specification it supports.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-A\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR decode all the units it recognises (including diagnostic
and linking units) within the TDF capsule.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-D\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR print a simple binary dump of the input file.  This
is intended for debugging purposes.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-E\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR report such information as the number of external tags
and tokens which it usually omits.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-S\fR
Because tokens may be defined in terms of other tokens and do not need
to be declared before they are defined, \fBdisp\fR makes two passes of
all the token definition units.  In the first pass it extracts only
the declaration information, stepping over the main body of the
definition.  On the second pass all the information is read.
The \fB-S\fR option makes \fBdisp\fR skip the first pass.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-T\fR
The skip pass described under the \fB-S\fR option is usual done silently,
without printing any information.  This is changed by the \fB-T\fR option.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-U\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR print the usage information associated with the
external tokens and tags and also any linkage information units within
the capsule.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-V\fR
By default \fBdisp\fR attempts to rationalise the TDF it reads.  In
particular it uses the external token and tag names whenever possible,
following the token and tag bindings to find these, and makes up names
for those tokens and tags which do not have external names.  The \fB-V\fR
option makes it not attempt any such rationalisation, but instead to
output exactly what it reads.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-W\fR
Makes \fBdisp\fR issue a warning about every token which is used before
it is declared.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The error reports if the input file is not a legal TDF capsule are
intended to aid developers writing programs which produce TDF.  Thus
they try to give all the information that may be required, including
the position within the input file that the error occurred.
