\fBsparctrans\fP - SPARC TDF translator on Solaris
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsparctrans\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIinput-fileoutput-file\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The code production portion of the TDF compiler is under the control of
a TDF translator, which translates a TDF capsule into an assembly source
file\&. There are separate TDF translators for each target architecture\&. This
manual page describes the translators which produce SPARC assembly code\&.
There are two versions, one for SunOS, and one for Solaris
.PP
It is recommended that \fBsparctrans\fP should not be
invoked directly, but via the user interface \fBtcc\fP\fB(1)\fP\&. The option
\fI-\fP\fIopt\fP can be passed to
\fBsparctrans\fP by passing the option
\fB-Wt,-\fP\fIopt\fP to
\fBtcc\fP\fB(1)\fP\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-A\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
inline calls to \fIalloca\fP\&. This is done by
default\&.
.IP "\fB-B\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
report floating point constants which exceed their range\&. This is
always done by default\&. If this option is switched off such constants
are replaced by infinity\&.
.IP "\fB-C\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
apply the "constants out of loops" optimisation\&. This optimisation is
performed by default\&.
.IP "\fB-D\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
produce Position Independent Code (PIC)\&. This is not done by default\&.
This option is not supported on the SCO or FreeBSD platforms, and on
the Linux platform it is supported only for ELF binary format\&.
.IP "\fB-E\fP" 5
This option disables \fBsparctrans\fP&39;s constant
overflow checks\&.
.IP "\fB-F\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should apply the "for all" optimisation\&. This is done by
default\&.
.IP "\fB-G\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-H\fP" 5
This option causes \fBsparctrans\fP to output
debugging information in its output file\&. This will only work if the
input TDF capsule contains debugging information\&. On the SCO platform
the format used by \fIdbxtra\fP and
\fIcodeview\fP is supported\&. On the SVR4\&.2
platform Dwarf 1 is supported, which is used by
\fIdebug\fP\&. On the Solaris, FreeBSD, and Linux
platforms, \fIstabs\fP is supported\&. The GNU debugger
\fIgdb\fP may be used on all platforms\&.
.IP "\fB-I\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
apply the "inlining" optimisation\&. This optimisation is performed by
default\&.
.IP "\fB-K\fP\fIstr\fP" 5
Causes \fBsparctrans\fP to optimise its code for a
particular processor model, determined by
\fIstr\fP\&. At present there are no valid values
for \fIstr\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-M\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
If this option is on, \fBsparctrans\fP preserves
division by a floating point number rather than replacing it by
multiplication by the reciprocal of the number\&. While the latter
produces faster code, it may lead to rounding errors\&. By default,
division by constants is preserved\&.
.IP "\fB-N\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-P\fP" 5
This option causes \fBsparctrans\fP to output
profiling information suitable for use with \fBprof\fP\fB(1)\fP or a
similar tool (see individual manual pages for details)\&. This option is
currently not supported on the Solaris platform\&.
.IP "\fB-Q\fP" 5
This option causes \fBsparctrans\fP to quit before
processing its input files\&. This is particularly useful in conjunction
with \fB-V\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-R\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
immediately round every floating point operation to its appropriate
range\&. This produces slower code, but is necessary for strict IEEE
conformance\&. The default is not to round after every operation\&.
.IP "\fB-U\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
apply the "loop unrolling" optimisation\&. This optimisation is performed
by default\&.
.IP "\fB-V\fP" 5
This option causes \fBsparctrans\fP to print its
version number and the version of the TDF specification it
supports\&.
.IP "\fB-W\fP\fIswitch\fP" 5
This option determines whether \fBsparctrans\fP should
make string literals writable\&. At present the C producer does not make
use of this facility, so strings are writable\&.
.IP "\fB-X\fP" 5
This option disables all optimisations\&. All
\fBsparctrans\fP&39;s optimisations are believed to be valid,
so that any error in optimisation is a genuine bug\&.
.IP "\fB-Z\fP" 5
This option causes \fBsparctrans\fP to print the
version number of all the TDF capsules it decodes\&.
.IP "\fB-a\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-c\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-g\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-i\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-l\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-n\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-r\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-t\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-u\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
