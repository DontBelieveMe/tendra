.TH alphatrans 1
.SH NAME
alphatrans \- TDF to DEC Alpha translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBalphatrans\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIinput-file\fR \fIbinary-assembler-file\fR
\fIsymbol-table-file\fR \fI[symbolic-assembler-file]
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
\
\fBalphatrans\fR compiles a target dependent TDF capsule into an AXP
assembler file.
.PP
It is recommended that  \fBalphatrans\fR not be invoked directly,  but
via the user interface \fItcc\fR(1).  Alpha specific options may be
passed to \fBalphatrans\fR by passing the option \fB-Wt,-\fIopt\fR to
\fItcc\fR(1).

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
These options are common to most translators, although the defaults may vary.
\fIswitch\fR stands for either \fB0\fR, to switch an option off, or \fB1\fR,
to switch it on.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-A\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR should inline calls to
\fIalloca\fR.  This is done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-B\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR should report floating point
constants which exceed their range.  This is always done by default.
If this option is switched off such constants are replaced by infinity.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-C\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether or not \fBalphatrans\fR applies the "constants
out of loops" optimisation.  This is done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-D\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether or not \fBalphatrans\fR produces Position
Independent Code (PIC).  This is not done by default.
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-S\fR
When this option is present \fBalphatrans\fR will produce a symbolic
assembler file in addition to its normal outputs.  In this case the
name of the symbolic assembler file must be present on the command line.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-E\fR
This option disables \fBalphatrans\fR's constant overflow checks.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-F\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether or not \fBalphatrans\fR applies the "for all"
optimisation.  This is not done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-H\fR
This option causes \fBalphatrans\fR to output debugging information.  
This will only work if the input TDF capsule contains debugging information.  
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-I\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR should apply the "inlining"
optimisation.  This is done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-K\fIstr\fR
Causes \fBalphatrans\fR to optimise its code for a particular processor
model, determined by \fIstr\fR.  Currently, this option has no effect.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-M\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR preserves division by a
floating point constant rather than replacing it by multiplication by
the reciprocal of the constant.  While the latter produces faster code,
it may lead to rounding errors.  By default, division by constants is
preserved.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-P\fR
This option causes \fBalphatrans\fR to output profiling information suitable
for use with \fIprof\fR(1) or a similar tool (see individual manual
pages for details).  This is not fully implemented on the current
version of \fBalphatrans\fR.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-Q\fR
This option causes \fBalphatrans\fR to quit before processing its input
files.  This is particularly useful in conjunction with \fB-V\fR.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-R\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR should immediately round every
floating point operation to its appropriate range.  This produces slower
code, but is necessary for strict IEEE conformance.  It is not 
done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-U\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR should apply the "loop
unrolling" optimisation.  This is done by default.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-V\fR
This option causes \fBalphatrans\fR to print its version number and the
version of the TDF specification it supports.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-W\fIswitch\fR
This option determines whether \fBalphatrans\fR makes string literals
writable. This is not implemented.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-X\fR
This option disables all optimisations.  All \fBalphatrans\fR's optimisations
are believed to be valid, so that any error in optimisation is a genuine
bug.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fB-Z\fR
This option causes \fBalphatrans\fR to print the version number of all the
TDF capsules it decodes.
