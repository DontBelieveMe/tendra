.SH "NAME" 
.PP 
\fBtdfc2\fP - C to TDF/ANDF producer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBtdfc2\fP [\fIoptions\fP]  [\fIinput-file\fP]  [\fIoutput-file\fP] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
In its default action, \fBtdfc2\fP translates the
input C source file, \fIinput-file\fP, into a TDF/ANDF
capsule, \fIoutput-file\fP\&. If the output file name is
omitted or is \fI-\fP, the standard output is used\&. If the
input file name is omitted or is \fI-\fP, the standard
input is used\&.
.PP
By use of the
\fB-s\fP\fIspec-file\fP option,
\fBtdfc2\fP can additionally be made to output a C spec file
which contains information enabling intermodule analysis to be performed\&.
Alternatively usage and error information suitable for processing by
other tools can be output using the
\fB-d\fP\fIopt\fP\fI=\fP\fIdump-file\fP option\&.
.PP
\fBtdfc2\fP also has a preprocessing action, when
invoked with the \fB-E\fP option, in which the input C source
file, \fIinput-file\fP, is preprocessed to an output file,
\fIouput-file\fP\&.
.PP
Finally \fBtdfc2\fP has a spec linker action, when
invoked with the \fB-S\fP option, in which any number of spec
input files, \fIinput-file\fP, are combined into a spec
output file, which may be specified using the \fB-s\fP option\&.
Any extra code generation resulting from this linking phase is written to
the TDF capsule, \fIoutput-file\fP\&.
.PP
It is recommended that \fBtdfc2\fP is invoked via
\fBtcc\fP\fB(1)\fP\&. Files with a \f(CW\&.c\fP suffix are
recognised as C source files\&. Options can be passed directly to
\fBtdfc2\fP using the
\fB-Wc,\fP\fIopt\fP option to
\fItcc\fP\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The command-line options can appear in any order and can be
interspersed with the input and output files\&. All the multi-part options
can be given either as one or two command-line arguments, so that
\fB-I\fP\fIdir\fP and \fB-I\fP\fIdir\fP are equivalent\&. Most of the option
handling required is handled by \fBtcc\fP\fB(1)\fP when this is being used,
but options may be passed directly to \fBtdfc2\fP using the
\fB-Wc,\fP\fIopt\fP option\&.
.IP "\fB-A\fP\fIpredicate\fP\fI(\fP\fItokens\fP\fI)\fP" 5
Asserts that the given predicate is true\&. The special case
\fB-A-\fP undefines all the built-in predicates (of
which there are none)\&.
.IP "\fB-D\fP\fImacro\fP" 5
Defines the given macro to be 1\&.
.IP "\fB-D\fP\fImacro\fP\fI=\fP\fItokens\fP" 5
Defines the given macro to be the given sequence of
preprocessing tokens\&.
.IP "\fB-E\fP" 5
Enables preprocessing mode in which the input C source file
is preprocessed into the output file\&.
.IP "\fB-F\fP\fIfile\fP" 5
Causes a list of options to be read from
\fIfile\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-H\fP" 5
Enables verbose inclusion mode in which warnings are printed
at the start and the end of each included source file\&.
.IP "\fB-I\fP\fIdirectory\fP" 5
Adds the given directory to the list searched by
\fBtdfc2\fP for included source files\&. No such
directories are built into \fBtdfc2\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-M\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-N\fP\fIname\fP\fI:\fP\fIdirectory\fP" 5
Is identical to
\fB-I\fP\fIdirectory\fP except that
it also associates the given identifier with the directory\&.
.IP "\fB-O\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-Q\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to quit immediately without
processing its input file\&. This is useful primarily in version
and option queries\&.
.IP "\fB-R\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-S\fP" 5
Enables spec linker mode in which any number of C spec input
files are linked into a single C spec output file\&.
.IP "\fB-U\fP\fImacro\fP" 5
Undefines the given macro\&. The special case
\fB-U-\fP undefines all the built-in macros\&. These are
\fI__FILE__\fP, \fI__LINE__\fP,
\fI__TIME__\fP, \fI__DATE__\fP,
\fI__STDC__\fP and
\fI__STDC_VERSION__\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-V\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to print its version
number\&.
.IP "\fB-W\fP\fIoption\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to print a warning in the
circumstances described by \fIoption\fP\&. The special
case \fB-Wall\fP enables a wide range of
warnings\&.
.IP "\fB-X\fP" 5
Disables exception handling\&. The current implementation can
be a large run-time overhead if not required\&. The effect of linking
any module compiled with this option with a module which throws an
exception is undefined\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-j-e\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-Z\fP\fInumber\fP" 5
Sets the maximum number of errors printed by
\fBtdfc2\fP before bailing out to be
\fInumber\fP\&. The default is 32\&.
.IP "\fB-a\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to apply complete program
analysis to its input files\&. That is it assumes that no other
translation units need to be linked in order for the program to
execute\&.
.IP "\fB-b\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-c\fP" 5
Disables TDF output\&. The output file will still be a valid
TDF capsule, only it will contain no information\&. This is
equivalent to \fB-j-c\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-d\fP\fIopt\fP\fI=\fP\fIdump-file\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to dump information about its
input file into \fIdump-file\fP\&.
\fIopt\fP is a series of characters describing the
information to be dumped; \fIc\fP for string
literals, \fIe\fP for errors, \fIh\fP for header files, \fIk\fP for keywords,
\fIl\fP for local variables, \fIm\fP for macros, \fIs\fP for scopes, and
\fIu\fP for usage\&. \fIa\fP is
equivalent to \fIehlmu\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-e\fP\fIfile\fP" 5
Specifies the given file as an end-up file\&. This is
equivalent to adding a \fI#include\fP directive for
this file at the end of the input source file\&.
.IP "\fB-f\fP\fIfile\fP" 5
Specifies the given file as a start-up file\&. This is
equivalent to adding a \fI#include\fP directive for
this file at the start of the input source file\&.
.IP "\fB-g\fP" 5
Specifies that the output TDF capsule should also contain
information to allow for the generation of run-time debugging
directives\&. This is equivalent to \fB-jg\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-h\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to print a full list of its
available command-line options\&. This includes a number not
documented here which are unlikely to prove useful to the normal
user\&.
.IP "\fB-i\fP\fIopt\fP" 5
Print dependency information usable for make(1)\&. Passing
-iM causes all headers to be printed, passing -iMM causes only
those headers between double quotes to be printed\&. The default
suffix for object files is \&.o and can be overridden with
-iO\fIext\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-j\fP\fIopt\fP" 5
Sets the TDF output options given by
\fIopt\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-m\fP\fIopt\fP" 5
Sets the error formatting options given by
\fIopt\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-n\fP\fIport-table\fP" 5
Specifies that the given portability table should be used to
specify the basic configuration parameters\&.
.IP "\fB-o\fP\fIoutput-file\fP" 5
Gives an alternative method of specifying the output
file\&.
.IP "\fB-r\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-s\fP\fIspec-file\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to write a C spec file
describing the input source file to
\fIspec-file\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-t\fP" 5
Specifies that \fBtdfc2\fP should include token
declarations in its output TDF capsule\&. While these are strictly
unnecessary, they help when pretty-printing the output\&. This is
equivalent to \fB-jt\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-u\fP\fI name \&.\&.\&. name\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to print the unmangle forms
of the given mangled identifier names\&.
.IP "\fB-v\fP" 5
Causes \fBtdfc2\fP to print the name of each
function to the standard output as it is compiled\&.
.IP "\fB-w\fP" 5
Disables all warning messages\&. This is equivalent to
\fB-mw\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-x\fP" 5
To be documented\&.
.IP "\fB-z\fP" 5
Forces \fBtdfc2\fP to produce an output file
even if compilation errors occur\&. The effect of installing a TDF
capsule produced using this option is undefined\&. This is equivalent
to \fB-mz\fP\&.
