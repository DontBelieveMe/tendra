			USER VISIBLE CHANGES TO SID
			===========================

Thu Feb 29 13:38:20 1996  Steve Folkes  (smf@rivers.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added support for an unreachable code macro (instead of a comment) in
    the C output languages.

Fri Jul 22 14:32:00 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * FROZE VERSION 1.8.

Tue Jul 19 14:05:20 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added assignment as an alternative to identity binding.

Thu Jul 14 15:19:08 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added initialisers for non local variables.

Fri Jul  1 14:09:02 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added support for non local variables within rules.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.7.

Wed Jun 22 14:01:08 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added support for language specific options.  Added options to control
    prototyping, use of numeric identifiers and casting of substituted
    parameters for C output language.

Thu Jun 16 15:41:59 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added support for call by reference and action parameter mutation
    information.

Fri May 27 13:33:04 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Changed the format of the C definition file to provide a parameter
    assignment operation (this should have been in from the start for
    consistent semantics).  Also, the prefix section, maps section and all
    three assignment operation sections are now optional.

Thu May 26 09:35:31 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Improved error messages.  Made dump file be updated with information
    from the phase that failed in the case of an error (this is not always
    useful though - the grammar may be in a useless state after a failed
    transform; left recursion elimination is particularly bad for this).

Tue May 17 15:30:33 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added a stricter ANSI C language that uses numeric identifiers to keep
    the identifier length below 32 characters.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.6.

Mon May 16 15:43:04 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Changed the syntax of the input files so that the grammar looks more
    like a conventional programming language.  Removed basics.  Added a
    header file to the C language output.

Wed Apr 27 14:41:48 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added "--show-errors" option to show the error table status, and a
    "--help" option to show the command line syntax.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.5.

Tue Apr 26 12:26:53 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Changed command line syntax to be compatible with the TDF linker.

Mon Apr 25 12:23:22 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * FROZE VERSION 1.4.

Mon Mar 28 15:17:20 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added "#line" directives to header and trailer.  Ensured that there is
    always a newline at the end of a code block.

Fri Mar 11 11:36:25 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added support for anonymous rules and in alternative exception
    handlers.  Fixed cycle detection routine used in needed function
    computation.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.3.

Tue Mar  8 17:56:17 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Changed syntax of code blocks in action file.  SID now inlines all
    actions, basics, assignments etc. and performs the substitutions.
    Substitutions allow for identifier and label substitution, as well as
    exception raising.

Fri Mar  4 17:28:52 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Put name identifiers in a separate namespace.  Stopped it being an
    error if the "-version" switch is used with no files specified.

Wed Mar  2 17:23:47 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added a test mode language.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.2.

Tue Mar  1 17:46:41 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added exception handling instead of old error reporting mechanism.

Fri Feb 18 15:12:20 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added option of inlining rules that only contain basics.  Changed
    output routines, so that parameters and results of inlined functions are
    substituted, rather than created and assigned to.

Thu Feb 17 16:33:47 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Changed identifier prefixes.  Made grammar printing mark inlinable
    rules with a '+'.

Wed Feb 16 17:55:25 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Added predicate support.  Improved factoring to allow alternatives
    with the same dataflow, but different names to be factored.  Allowed
    types to be defined that were only the result types of terminals.
    Stopped rules being declared as entry points to the grammar multiple
    times.

Fri Feb  4 16:54:38 1994  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Fixed the cycle detection routines used in tail recursion detection.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.1.

Wed Feb 2 17:20:07 1994 Steve Folkes (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb) 

    * Fixed the cycle detection routines used in left recursion detection.
    Fixed bug in outputting code for see through alternatives.  Sorted error
    lists to make comparisons easier.  Modified grammar printing to mark
    tail calls.

Wed Dec 22 11:42:50 1993  Steve Folkes  (smf@arrow.dra.hmg.gb)

    * Initial version of the new sid.  Adds dataflow and marginally improved
    error handling to the original version of sid.  Also fixes some bugs in
    the algorithms used in the earlier version of sid.

    * FROZE VERSION 1.0.
