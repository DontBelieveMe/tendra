/**** file-name.h --- File name manipulation routines.
 *
 ** Author: Steve Folkes <smf@hermes.mod.uk>
 *
 **** Commentary:
 *
 ***=== INTRODUCTION =========================================================
 *
 * This file defines some file name manipulation routines.  It should be
 * replaced on operating systems with a different file name syntax to that
 * used here ('/' separated path names).
 *
 ***=== FUNCTIONS ============================================================
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		file_name_basename
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP path))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory
 *
 * This function returns a dynamically allocated copy of the file name
 * component of the specifed path.
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		file_name_dirname
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP path))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory
 *
 * This function returns a dynamically allocated copy of the directory name
 * component of the specifed path.
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		file_name_expand
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP dir, CStringP name,
 *				  CStringP suffix))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory
 *
 * This function returns a dynamically allocated copy of the path name
 * obtained by expanding the specified name in the specified dir.  If the
 * suffix is non nil, it is also appended to the path name, following the
 * suffix seperator character.
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		file_name_is_basename
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP path))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function returns true if the specified path has no directory
 * component.
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		file_name_is_absolute
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP path))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function returns true if the specified path is an absolute path name.
 *
 ** Function:	void			file_name_populate
 *			PROTO_S ((CStringP path))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function tries to create all of the directories on the specified path.
 * The final component of the path is considered to be a file, and is not
 * created as a directory.  There is no confirmation of whether the function
 * succeeds or not - this must be determined in another manner.
 *
 **** Change Log:
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.2  2002/01/27 10:28:11  asmodai
 * Fix spelling of separate and derived words.
 *

 * Initial version of TenDRA 4.1.2.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1998/01/17  15:57:18  release
 * First version to be checked into rolling release.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/12/12  11:45:39  smf
 * Performing changes for 'CR94_178.sid+tld-update' - bringing in line with
 * OSSG C Coding Standards.
