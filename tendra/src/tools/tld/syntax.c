/**** syntax.c --- Character classification.
 *
 ** Author: Steve Folkes <smf@hermes.mod.uk>
 *
 **** Commentary:
 *
 * This file implements the syntax table facility specified in the file
 * "syntax.h". See that file for more details.
 *
 * This particular implementation assumes that the ASCII character set is
 * being used. It will need changing for other character sets.
 *
 **** Change Log:
 * $Log$
