 *** Commentary:
 *
 * This file implements the mapping table routines used by the TDF linker.
 *
 *** Change Log:
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2002/01/26 21:32:05  asmodai
 * Initial version of TenDRA 4.1.2.

 * Fixed some problems in "name-key.c" (no real problems, but rewritten to
 * reduce the warnings that were output by "tcc" and "gcc").
 * Fixed bug CR95_354.tld-common-id-problem (library capsules could be loaded
 * more than once).
