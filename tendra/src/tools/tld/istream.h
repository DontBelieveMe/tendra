/**** istream.h --- Input stream handling.
 *
 ** Author: Steve Folkes <smf@hermes.mod.uk>
 *
 **** Commentary:
 *
 ***=== INTRODUCTION =========================================================
 *
 * This file specifies the interface to the input stream facility.
 *
 ***=== TYPES ================================================================
 *
 ** Type:	IStreamT
 ** Type:	IStreamP
 ** Repr:	<private>
 *
 * This is the input stream type.
 *
 ** Type:	IStreamStatusT
 ** Type:	IStreamStatusP
 ** Repr:	enum {ISTREAM_STAT_READ_CHAR, ISTREAM_STAT_NO_CHAR,
 *		      ISTREAM_STAT_SYNTAX_ERROR}
 *
 * This is the return type of the ``istream_read_escaped_char'' function.  The
 * constants represent the results: a character was read, no character was
 * read, and a syntax error occured respectively.
 *
 ***=== CONSTANTS ============================================================
 *
 ** Constant:	istream_input
 *
 * This value is a pointer to an input stream object that will read from the
 * standard input.  The ``istream_setup'' function must be called before this
 * constant is used.
 *
 ***=== FUNCTIONS ============================================================
 *
 ** Function:	void			istream_setup
 *			PROTO_S ((void))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function initialises the input stream facility.  It should be called
 * before any other istream manipulation function.
 *
 ** Function:	void			istream_init
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function initialises the specified istream not to read from any file.
 *
 ** Function:	BoolT			istream_open
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream, CStringP name))
 ** Exceptions: XX_dalloc_no_memory, XX_istream_read_error
 *
 * This function initialises the specified istream to read from the file with
 * the specified name.  The name should not be modified or deallocated until
 * the istream has been closed.  If the file cannot be opened, the function
 * returns false. If the file is opened successfully, the function returns
 * true.
 *
 ** Function:	void			istream_assign
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP to, IStreamP from))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function assigns the from istream to the to istream.  The from istream
 * should not be used again.
 *
 ** Function:	BoolT			istream_is_open
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 *
 * This function returns true if the specified istream is reading from a file,
 * and false otherwise.
 *
 ** Function:	BoolT			istream_read_char
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream, char *c_ref))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory, XX_istream_read_error
 *
 * This function reads the next character from the specified istream (and
 * advances the character pointer).  If a character is read then the character
 * is assigned to the reference argument, and the function returns true.  If
 * the end of file is reached, the function returns false.  If the character
 * read is a newline, then the istream's line count is incremented.
 *
 ** Function:	BoolT			istream_peek_char
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream, char *c_ref))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory, XX_istream_read_error
 *
 * This function reads the next character from the specified istream (but does
 * not advance the character pointer).  If a character is read then the
 * character is assigned to the reference argument, and the function returns
 * true.  If the end of file is reached, the function returns false.
 *
 ** Function:	IStreamStatusT		istream_read_escaped_char
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream, char *c_ref))
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory, XX_istream_read_error
 *
 * This function reads a character sequence from the specified istream, and
 * parses it as an escaped character sequence.  Normally, the character to
 * which the sequence evaluates is assigned to the reference argument and
 * ``ISTREAM_STAT_READ_CHAR'' is returned.  If if it evaluates to no
 * character, then ``ISTREAM_STAT_NO_CHAR'' is returned (this is not an
 * error).  If there is an error in the syntax of the character sequence, then
 * ``ISTREAM_STAT_SYNTAX_ERROR'' is returned.  If any of the characters read
 * are newline characters, then the istream's line counter will be incremented
 * for each newline.
 *
 ** Function:	void			istream_inc_line
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function increments the specified istream's line counter.  It should
 * only really be called as specified in the documentation for the
 * ``ISTREAM_READ_CHAR'' macro.
 *
 ** Function:	unsigned		istream_line
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function returns the line number of the specified istream (one more
 * than the number of newlines that have been read).
 *
 ** Function:	CStringP		istream_name
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function returns the name of the file from which the specified istream
 * is reading. The return value should not be modified or deallocated.
 *
 ** Function:	void			istream_close
 *			PROTO_S ((IStreamP istream))
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This function closes the specified istream.
 *
 ***=== MACROS ===============================================================
 *
 ** Macro:	ISTREAM_READ_CHAR (istream)
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This macro returns the next character from the specified istream.  It is a
 * slightly faster alternative to the ``istream_read_char'' function.  In
 * order to get the speed improvement, the program needs to do some extra
 * work: if the character returned is a newline, then the program must call
 * the ``istream_inc_line'' function to increment the line count; if the
 * character returned is a null character, then the program must call the
 * ``ISTREAM_HANDLE_NULL'' macro on the istream that was read.  It is not
 * obvious that the speed increase is worth the extra effort in coding.
 *
 ** Macro:	ISTREAM_PEEK_CHAR (istream)
 ** Exceptions:
 *
 * This macro returns the next character from the specified istream, without
 * reading it.  It is a slightly faster alternative to the
 * ``istream_peek_char'' function.  In order to get the speed improvement, the
 * program needs to do some extra work: if the character returned is the null
 * character, then the program must call the ``ISTREAM_HANDLE_NULL'' macro on
 * the istream that was read.  Unlike the ``ISTREAM_READ_CHAR'' macro, it is
 * not necessary to increment the istream's line count.  It is not obvious
 * that the speed increase is worth the extra effort in coding.
 *
 ** Macro:	ISTREAM_HANDLE_NULL (istream, redo, eof)
 ** Exceptions:	XX_dalloc_no_memory, XX_istream_read_error
 *
 * This macro should be called when either of the previous two macros returns
 * the null character.  It checks to see if the null character is really a
 * null character, a refill buffer instruction, or an end of file.  If it is a
 * real null character, then the program continues normally.  If it is a
 * refill buffer instruction, the istream's buffer is refilled, and the
 * program goes to the label ``redo''.  If it is an end of file, then the
 * program goes to the label ``eof''.
 *
 ***=== EXCEPTIONS ===========================================================
 *
 ** Exception:	XX_istream_read_error (CStringP name)
 *
 * This exception is raised if a read attempt fails.  The data thrown is a
 * copy of the name of the file that the read error occured on.  The copy
 * should be deallocated when finished with.
