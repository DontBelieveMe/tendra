    <title>Standard library</title>

	<para>At present the default implementation contains only a very small fraction
		of the ISO C++ library, namely those headers -
		<code>&lt;exception&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;new&gt;</code> and
		<code>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</code> - which are an integral part of the
		language specification.  These headers are also those which require
		the most cooperation between the producer and the library implementation,
		as described in the <A HREF="lib.html">previous section</A>.</para>

	<para>It is suggested that if further library components are required then
		they be acquired from third parties.  It should be noted however that
		such libraries may require <link linkend="porting">some effort</link> to be
		ported to an ISO compliant compiler; for example, some information
		on porting the <code>libio</code> component of <code>libg++</code>,
		which contains some very compiler-dependent code, are
		<link linkend="libio">given below</link>.  Libraries compiled with other C++
		compilers may not link correctly with modules compiled using <code>tcc</code>.</para>
