	<title id="wb">Token identification</title>

	<para>The syntax for the token-identification is as follows:</para>

	<programlisting language="BNF">
token identification:
	<replaceable>name-space</replaceable><subscript><replaceable>opt</replaceable></subscript><replaceable>identifier</replaceable> # <replaceable>external-identifier</replaceable><subscript><replaceable>opt</replaceable></subscript>

name-space:
	TAG</programlisting>

	<para>There is a default name space associated with each kind of token
		and internal identifiers for tokens generally reside in these
		default name spaces. The ISO C standard describes the five name
		spaces as being:</para>

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>The label space, in which all label identifiers reside;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>The tag space, in which structure, union and enumeration tags
				reside;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>The member name space, in which structure and union member
				selectors reside;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>The macro name space, in which all macro definitions reside.
				Token identifiers in the macro name space have no definition and so
				are not expanded. However, they behave as macros in all other
				respects;</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>The ordinary name space in which all other identifiers
				reside.</para>
		</listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>The exception is compound type-token identifiers (see F.7.4
		Compound type tokens) which by default reside in the ordinary name
		space but can be forced to reside in the tag name space by setting
		the optional <replaceable>name-space</replaceable> to be <code>TAG</code>.</para>

	<para>The first identifier of the <replaceable>token-identification</replaceable>
		provides the internal identification of the token. This is the name
		used to identify the token within the program. It must be followed
		by a <code>#</code>.</para>

	<para>All further preprocessing tokens until the end of the line are
		treated as part of the <replaceable>external-identifier</replaceable>
		with non-empty white space sequences being replaced by a single space.
		The <replaceable>external-identifier</replaceable> specifies the external
		identification of the token which is used for TDF linking.
		External token identifications reside in their own name space which
		is distinct from the external name space for functions and objects.
		This means that it is possible to have both a function and a token
		with the same external identification.
		If the external-identifier is omitted it is assumed that the internal
		and external identifications are the same.</para>
