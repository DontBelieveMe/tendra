  <para>
  This document describes various of the implementation details of the
  C++ producer TDF output.  In particular it describes the standard
  TDF tokens used to represent the target dependent aspects of the language
  and to provide links into the run-time system.  Many of these tokens
  are common to the C and C++ producers.  Those which are unique to
  the C++ producer have names of the form <code>~cpp.*</code>.  Note
  that the description is in terms of TDF tokens, not the internal tokens
  introduced by the
  <A HREF="token.html"><code>#pragma token</code> syntax</A>.
  </para>
  <para>
  There are two levels of implementation in the run-time system.  The
  actual interface between the producer and the run-time system is given
  by the standard tokens.  The provided implementation defines these
  tokens in a way appropriate to itself.  An alternative implementation
  would have to define the tokens differently.  It is intended that
  the standard tokens are sufficiently generic to allow a variety of
  implementations to hook into the producer output in the manner they
  require.
