  <para>The code production portion of the TDF compiler is under the control of
    a TDF translator, which translates a TDF capsule,<emphasis>inf</emphasis>,
    into assembly files. There are separate TDF translators for each target
    architecture. This manual page describes the translators which produce MIPS
    code. There are two versions, one for IRIX, and one for ULTRIX. Both produce
    .G and .H files required by as1, but may also optionally give .s assembly
    files using <option>-S</option>. Note that full run-time diagnostic
    information cannot be transmitted through the MIPS assembler, as(1).</para>
