	<para>TenDRA is a relatively complex system. This document attempts
		to orientate the reader amongst the maze of file types, and to
		help show how it all fits together. The focus here is primarily
		on what files live where, and how they are involved; the details
		of each stage are not discussed at length.</para>

	<para>A few examples are given, and it is recommended that you follow
		along and experiment with various alterations whilst reading.
		This is not a comprehensive guide; it only covers the areas which
		seemed to be most relevant.</para>
