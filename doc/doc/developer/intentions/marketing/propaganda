Propaganda
==========

Propaganda covers comparisons of TenDRA to other similar software. This
needn't be biased; it is perfectly acceptable for us to recommend tools more
suitable for a specific job.

The purpose of this, then, is for us to state how TenDRA's projects are worth
using for their particular intended uses.

None of this is relevant right now, as this is inherently targeted at users.
