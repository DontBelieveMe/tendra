		<title>Objectives</title>
		
		<para>In previous work, we performed validation, performance and
			robustness testing of the TenDRA technology to ensure its capability
			to implement and fully bootstrap a UNIX-like operating system. We also
			provided an assessment of the capability of TenDRA technology to
			express a fully portable operating system implementation. This work
			was very successful, and the results are reported in a
			summary report.
			<!-- TODO: <biblioref linkend="Ferri&egrave;re95-2">summary report</biblioref> -->
		</para>

		<para>However, though we originally planned to conduct this first
			experiment on two different architectures, an Intel/486 and a
			Sun/Sparc platforms running UnixWare, it was completed only for the
			Intel/486 platform.	After discussions with DRA, it was then decided
			to focus the second part of the project on the Unix commands, and to
			switch from the UnixWare to the Linux operating system. The
			motivations for a revised plan were:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>OSF is developing a Linux server for the Intel/486 and
					PowerPC platforms, and we would like to deliver the set of
					associated commands in ANDF format. In the event, native Linux
					commands for PowerPC became available in the meantime.</para>
			</listitem>
			
			<listitem>
				<para>Repeating on the Sparc platform the work already done on the
					i486 platform would bring little added-value, while requiring a
					significant amount of work.	The major benefit of the work on a
					second platform would be to demonstrate that a set of commands along
					with its API can be defined in ANDF format and then installed on two
					different platforms.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>Thus, the objective of the second part of the project is the
			production in ANDF format of Linux commands, and their installation on
			two platforms. This will demonstrate the ability of the TenDRA
			technology to produce a set of architecture neutral commands and, at
			completion of the project, will provide a set of freely distributable
			commands in ANDF format.</para>

		<para>The project, which lasted 9 months, started on July 1995, and was
			finished at the end of March 1996.</para>

		<para>This report summarizes all the work done under the contract for
			this second part of the project.</para>

		<title>General description</title>
		
		<para>The commands, one part of a Unix system, are based on some
			standard APIs, XPG3 for example, plus some extensions, which together
			form the interface shared with the libraries against which they are
			built. The commands should not have any assembly code, unlike the
			other parts of a Unix system.</para>
		
		<para>As for other software OSF already ported to ANDF, the port of the
			Linux commands is done in three steps:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>The NAT-NAT step, which consists in rebuilding the commands
			 		 with the native compilation chain, to ensure that they can be
					regenerated from their source files.</para>
			</listitem>
			
			<listitem>
				<para>The DRA-NAT step, for which the TenDRA technology is used as
					a replacement of the native compilation chain to build the commands,
					using the native system header files, as for a classical compilation
					chain. This part involves dealing with discrepancies between the
					native and the TenDRA code generators.</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>The DRA-DRA step, which will consist in using the TenDRA
					technology as a portability tool. The API shared by the commands and
					libraries is defined, and used to produce the commands in
					architecture independent ANDF code. This code will be installed and
					validated on the selected machines.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		
		<para>We initially planned to conduct the experiment on the Intel/i386
			and IBM/PowerPc platforms, both running the Linux operating system.
			However, the Linux system for the IBM/PowerPC platform was still under
			development at the time we needed it, in December 1995. So we decided
			to replace it by a Digital/Alpha platform, the only other platform for
			which a Linux port was sufficiently advanced at that time.	However,
			it is a 64-bit platform, so this switch was more of a challenge,
			because of the fundamental change in data sizes. It provided
			additional tests of the TenDRA portability attributes.</para>
