		<title>Statistics for Linux APIs</title>

		<para>All the files required to create an API are located inside
			a special sub-tree of the TenDRA [4.x] distribution named <code>src/apis/</code>.
			First, the new API must be specified, in a dedicated language (the TenDRA <code>tspec</code>
			tool is provided to translate such API specification into a target-independent
			intermediate format). An API specification is split into files, each of which
			usually corresponding to a system header file available on the target
			platform(s); e.g.: <code>stdio.h, sys/types.h</code>, etc.</para>

		<para>Secondly, there is often the need for slight changes within
			some of the system header files of a given target, in order to build (to
			install) the new API on it; such changes are either hard-coded inside a
			replacement version for the relevant headers, or automatically performed using
			scripts of text processing commands; the <code>sed</code> tool, along with <code>sed</code>
			scripts, are used to deal with common APIs (for UNIX-like systems) included in
			current TenDRA distributions. We think that the second method is more flexible;
			for example, the text processing commands to apply on the system header files in
			order to build successfully our custom APIs for Linux were in most cases the
			same among Linux/i386 and Linux/Alpha targets, so we have written a single set
			of sed scripts suitable for both of these platforms.</para>

		<para><!-- TODO: <xref linkend="apisforlinux"/> -->The following table gives an
			idea of the amount of work required to specify and to build the APIs used by the
			~230 Linux commands which were ported to ANDF. Two types of data are reported:
			&ldquo;number of files&rdquo; and &ldquo;number of lines&rdquo;. The files are modules holding lines of
			either API specification or of sed commands. We excluded from our statistics the
			comment lines for both, because the ratio of comments versus actual <code>tspec/sed</code>
			constructs was unusually high.</para>

		<para>We recall that our Base API for Linux was derived from
			existing &ldquo;standard&rdquo; APIs, i.e. mainly from XPG3 and SVID3, which themselves
			use parts of POSIX. Consequently, the number of tspec <code>lines</code> for this API
			which is shown below does not reflect the actual amount of lines of
			specification having been used: most of the specifications we wrote are similar
			to C language <code>#include</code> statements (&tspec; <code>+IMPLEMENT</code> or <code>+USE</code>
			constructs).</para>

		<para>In our &ldquo;Extension API 1&rdquo;, we have not uncommonly rewritten
			specifications which had an equivalent (either identical or similar) within the
			reference SVID3 API or SPEC1070 API.</para>

		<para>We recall also that we did not start from scratch when
			making the changes in Linux system headers in order to build our APIs, either
			for Linux/i386 or Linux/Alpha targets: the TenDRA Snapshot we started from
			(April 95) provided 11 <code>sed</code> scripts for this purpose, that were
			sufficient to build most of the XPG3 API for the Linux/i386 target.</para>

		<para>The number of <code>files</code> given for &ldquo;Changes in system
			headers&rdquo; is the one for the 1st target, Linux/i386 (1.0): as already mentioned,
			the build of APIs for the 2nd target, Linux/Alpha (1.3), uses the same set of
			sed scripts. This means that the number of <code>lines</code> corresponds to the <code>sed</code>
			commands which apply either to a Linux/Intel system header, to a Linux/Alpha
			header or to both.</para>

		<title>Statistics concerning changes in the original source code</title>

		<para><!-- TODO: <xref linkend="i386andalphaports"/> -->The following table lists the
			packages we installed and validated on both platforms. The first column
			gives the (Slackware Linux) name of the package, and the second gives the
			number of source files we dealt with during the ANDFization. The following
			column gives the number of files - actual source or Makefile - patched
			during either the initial ANDFization (keeping the i386 as target), or the
			port to the 2nd target (Alpha). The two last columns show the number of
			files specifically (re)patched during the port to Alpha, and finally the
			number of patched Makefiles (that for the overall project).</para>

		</table>

		<para>From the data shown in the table above <!-- TODO: <xref linkend="i386andalphaports"/> -->,
			we can say that about 80% of the original source files did not require
			any change when ported to ANDF. We find also that we encountered, during the
			initial ANDFization and the validation on the 1st platform, more than 70% of the
			files requiring changes. In other words, we had missed approximately 30% of
			required changes. Note that in our project both of the platforms were running
			the same UNIX-like variant (Linux), so the last ratio could be greater in a less
			favorable case. Finally, since the Intel/i386 and Digital/Alpha feature
			different sizes for pointer type (and <code>long</code> type), while the byte ordering is
			the same, there is probably still incorrect code lying inside our ANDF files for
			Linux commands.</para>
