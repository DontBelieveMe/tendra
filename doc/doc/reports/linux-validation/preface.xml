	<title>Executive Summary</title>

	<para>During a first phase of the project the main goal was to examine
		the extent to which the TenDRA technology could be used to compile a
		complete operating sytem. This experiment was carried out on the
		Unixware operating system on an Intel 486 platform. Although Unix
		sources are known to be compiler dependent, it was found that most of
		the code could be compiled with no, or minor, modifications.	Details
		of the results can be found in a report.</para>

	<para>The goal of this second phase of the project was
		to study the feasibility of producing Unix commands in architecture
		neutral (ANDF) format which could be readily ported to different
		hardware platforms running the same operating system.	The target
		system chosen for this second phase was Linux, which was available on
		both the Intel and DEC Alpha platforms (although the latter was
		incomplete at the beginning of the project).</para>
		
	<para>The experiment carried out during this second phase was very
		successful.	A significant amount of complex code was converted to the
		architecture neutral ANDF format, and the portability of this code was
		demonstrated. However, due to time constraints, the number of commands
		ported to both platforms was more limited than had been hoped.	The
		project also provided some interesting lessons about the strengths and
		limitations of the ANDF/TenDRA technology and about API issues. This is
		the final report on work undertaken on the Linux operating system on
		the Intel/i386 and Digital/Alpha platforms.</para>
