		<title>LINUX operating system</title>

		<para>Linux is a free Unix-like operating system, first developed by
			Linus Torvalds on an Intel platform; &ldquo;official&rdquo; releases exist since
			October 1991.</para>

		<para>It has now been ported to Digital/Alpha and ports to other
			machines, including PowerPC andPowerMAC, are under way.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Linux on Intel/i386</title>

			<para>There are many distributions of Linux for the Intel
				platform; we installed the Slackware distribution, based on the Linux 1.1
				version.</para>

			<para>We downloaded it from the ftp site:
				<ulink url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware">sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware</ulink></para>

			<para>The version we installed was Linux 1.1.59, available since
				October 1994. Since then, newer versions have been released, but we stuck to
				this version throughout the project since it worked well, and because all the
				packages it included were easily available in source form (see below).</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Source code for Linux commands used by the project</title>

			<para>We downloaded the source code of the Linux commands from
				the ftp site: <ulink url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware/source">sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware/source</ulink>.</para>

			<para>This means that the versions of commands available on our
				development machine for Linux/i386 were matching the source code we used as base
				for the project, except in a few cases for which the source code had been
				revised.</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Linux on Digital/Alpha</title>

			<para>For the Alpha platform, Linux is available from the BLADE
				distribution, and more recently from the Red Hat distribution.</para>

			<para>A 32-bit version of Linux/Alpha was first released in
				January 1995; then a 64-bit version was available in November 1995, which
				included most of the capabilities provided by the Linux/Intel system. We
				downloaded the BLADE_0.3 release, consisting of more than thirty floppy images,
				from the ftp site: <ulink url="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha">ftp.digital.com:/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha</ulink></para>

			<para>Since December 1995, another Linux/Alpha distribution has
				become available from the RedHat company; it is built from the same components,
				but newer versions, as the BLADE release.</para>

			<para>An interesting feature of the current Linux/Alpha ports, is
				that they provide rather extensive binary compatibility with Digital Unix. This
				compatibility has been used to cross-build on Digital Unix for Linux/Alpha, and
				also for a few features which were not available in the Linux/Alpha BLADE
				release.</para>

		<title>Hardware platforms and environment</title>

		<para>The Intel platform was an Intel/i486 PC machine, with
			most disk space available through NFS.</para>

		<para>The Digital/Alpha platform was built specifically for
			this project, around a Digital AXPpci 33 motherboard. In fact, at the
			time we set-up the machine, the Linux/Alpha ports were only running on a few
			Alpha-based machines.</para>

		<para>A Linux kernel had to be rebuilt for this machine in order
			to add support for the 3COM Ethernet board we used, and for the NFS-client
			capability. Most disk space was thus available through an NFS file system,
			shared with the Intel platform.</para>

	<section>
		<title>TenDRA technology</title>

		<para>We started the project on an Intel platform with a snapshot of the
			TenDRA technology from April 1995, which included support for the
			Linux/Intel platform. This snapshot was based on the ANDF 3.1
			specification.</para>

		<para>We switched to the November 1995 TenDRA snapshot, based on ANDF 4.0,
			when we setup the second platform, in order to use the tools for the
			Digital Unix/Alpha platform. Because of the high degree of compatibility
			between Digital Unix and Linux on Alpha, we could use the TenDRA
			technology on a DigitalUnix/Alpha platform to cross-build executables for
			the Linux/Alpha platform.</para>

		<para>The ANDF 4.0 intermediate file format is not upward compatible with
			the ANDF 3.1 one, which required that we rebuild the intermediate ANDF
			files for the Linux commands we had already built.</para>

		<para>ANDF 4.0 contains increased capability, though not required by this
			project, and forms the basis for the X/Open preliminary
			specification XANDF.</para>
