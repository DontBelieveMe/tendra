	<title>Conclusion</title>

	<para>The experiment to compile a whole Unix system with the TenDRA
		compiler used as a replacement of the native compiler was very
		successful.  Although Unix sources are known to be compiler dependent,
		most of the code could be compiled with no, or minor, modifications.
		Also, we found very few bugs in the technology, and the performance of
		the system did not change noticeably.</para>

	<para>The DRA-DRA part of the experiment showed that defining an API for
		the commands was not as simple as one might think. A more complete
		experiment is required to complement this task.</para>
