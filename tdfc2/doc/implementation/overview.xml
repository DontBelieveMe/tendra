    <title>Program overview</title>

	<para>The C++ producer is a large program (over 200000 lines, including
		automatically generated code) written in C.	A description of the
		<link linkend="structure">program structure</link> and the basic organisation
		of the source code are described in the first section.</para>

	<para>One of the design methods used in the C++ producer is the extensive
		use of automatic code generation tools.	The type system is based
		around the &calculus; tool, which allows complex type systems
		to be described in a simple format.	The interface generated by &calculus;
		allows for rigorous static type checking, generic type constructors
		for lists, stacks etc., encapsulation of the operations on the types
		within the system, and optional run-time checking for null pointers
		and discriminated union tags. An overview is given of the
		<link linkend="typesystem">type system</link>
		used as the basis of the C++ producer design.
		Also see the &calculus-userguide.doc;.</para>

	<para>The other general purpose code generation tool used in the C++ producer
		is the parser generator, &sid;.
		A brief description of
		the problems in writing a <link linkend="parsing">C++ parser</link> is given.
		Also see the &sid-userguide.doc;.</para>

	<para>The other code generation tools used were written specifically for
		the C++ producer.	The error reporting routines within the producer
		are based on an <link linkend="errors">error catalogue</link>, from which
		code for constructing and printing errors is generated.
		The TDF output routines are based on primitives
		automatically generated from a standard database describing the TDF
		specification.</para>

	<para>The program itself is well commented, so no lower level program documentation
		has been provided.	When performing development work the producer
		should be compiled without the <code>NDEBUG</code> macro defined. This
		enables the &calculus; run-time checks, along with other
		assertions, and makes available the debugging routines,
		<code>DEBUG_</code><emphasis>type</emphasis>,
		which can be used to print an object from the internal type system.</para>
