    <title>Standard library</title>

	<para>At present the default implementation contains only a very small fraction
		of the ISO C++ library, namely those headers -
		<code>&lt;exception&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;new&gt;</code> and
		<code>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</code> - which are an integral part of the
		language specification.  These headers are also those which require
		the most cooperation between the producer and the library implementation,
		as described in &tdfc2-devguide.doc;.</para>

	<para>It is suggested that if further library components are required then
		they be acquired from third parties.  It should be noted however that
		such libraries may require some effort to be
		ported to an ISO compliant compiler; for example, some information
		on porting the <code>libio</code> component of <code>libg++</code>,
		which contains some very compiler-dependent code, are given in
		the &cppporting.doc; document.
		Libraries compiled with other C++
		compilers may not link correctly with modules compiled using <code>tcc</code>.</para>
