		<title>Intermodule analysis</title>

		<warning>
			<para>The C++ spec linking routines have not yet been completely implemented,
					and so are disabled in the current version of the C++ producer.</para>
		</warning>

		<para>A C++ spec file is a dump of the C++ producer's internal
			representation of a translation unit.  Such files can be written
			to, and read from, disk to perform such operations as intermodule
			analysis.</para>

		<para>Note that the format of a C++ spec file is specific to the C++ producer
			and may change between releases to reflect modifications in the internal
			type system.  The C producer has a similar dump format, called a C
			spec file, however the two are incompatible.  If intermodule analysis
			between C and C++ source files is required then the &tdfcdump.5; symbol
			table dump format should be used.</para>

		<title>Other checks</title>

		<para>Several checks of varying utility have been implemented in the C++
			producer but do not as yet have individual directives controlling
			their use.	These can be enabled <emphasis>en masse</emphasis> using the directive:</para>

			<programlisting language="cpp">#pragma TenDRA++ catch all <emphasis>allow</emphasis></programlisting>

		<para>It is intended that this directive will be phased out as these checks
			are assigned controlling directives.	It is possible to achieve finer
			control over these checks by enabling their individual error messages
			<link linkend="low">as described above</link>.</para>
