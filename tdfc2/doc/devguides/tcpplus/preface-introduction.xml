	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>This document describes various of the implementation details of the
		C++ producer TDF output.  In particular it describes the standard
		TDF tokens used to represent the target dependent aspects of the language
		and to provide links into the run-time system.  Many of these tokens
		are common to the C and C++ producers.  Those which are unique to
		the C++ producer have names of the form <code>~cpp.*</code>.  Note
		that the description is in terms of TDF tokens, not the internal tokens
		introduced by the &pragmatoken.doc;.</para>

	<para>There are two levels of implementation in the run-time system.
		The actual interface between the producer and the run-time system is given
		by the standard tokens.  The provided implementation defines these
		tokens in a way appropriate to itself.  An alternative implementation
		would have to define the tokens differently.  It is intended that
		the standard tokens are sufficiently generic to allow a variety of
		implementations to hook into the producer output in the manner they
		require.</para>
