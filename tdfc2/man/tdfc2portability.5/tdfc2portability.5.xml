		<title>Syntax</title>

		<para>The default portability table values, which are built into the producer,
			can be expressed in the form:</para>

		<programlisting language="porttable">char_bits            8
short_bits           16
int_bits             16
long_bits            32
signed_range         symmetric
char_type            either
ptr_int              none
ptr_fn               no
non_prototype_checks yes
multibyte            1</programlisting>

		<para>This illustrates the syntax for the portability table; note that all
			ten entries are required, even though the last four are ignored.</para>

		<para>The decimal integer associated with each of
			<emphasis>char_bits</emphasis>, <emphasis>short_bits</emphasis>,
			<emphasis>int_bits</emphasis> and <emphasis>long_bits</emphasis>
			gives the minimum number of bits in the representation of each
			integer type on all target machines. For example, if
			<emphasis>int_bits</emphasis> is set to <code>32</code> the
			compiler will perform its checks in the knowledge that the
			program will not be used on a machine whose <code>int</code>
			types are represented by 16 bits although they might be
			represented by 32 or 64 bits.</para>
