/*
    ELEMENTARY TYPES

    A byte is used to represent a single 8-bit number read from the
    input file.  A pointer is a generic pointer.
*/

/*
    INPUT FILE POSITION

    A place is used to record positions in the input file.  It consists
    of the byte number within the file, the bit number within that byte,
    and an 8-bit input buffer.

/*
    IDENTIFIER TYPES

    A string is used to represent TDF strings.  A unique is a null-terminated
    array of strings.  An external is either a string or a unique.

    Each TDF sort name is represented by an identifying integer.  A sort

    also have an associated foreign sort name.

    A token is represented by a structure giving the result sort,

    implicit sort (for tokens which are used before they are declared
    or defined).

    its internal identifying number, plus extra information depending
    on the type of object represented (see below).
