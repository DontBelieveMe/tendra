		<title>Description</title>

		<para>&disp; translates the input &tdf; capsule, &in-file.arg; into a
			human-readable form, the layout of which reflects the structure of
			the underlying &tdf; tree.
			If the &out-file.arg; argument is present, this is used for output;
			otherwise the standard output is used.</para>

		<para>Whenever possible the output of &disp; matches the &tdf;
			specification.
			The most important exception is the use of asterisks after
			a token name to indicate an application of that token.
			Also a dash is used to indicate the absense of an optional
			argument and an ellipsis (<literal>...</literal>) is used to
			indicate that a token's arguments have been skipped rather than
			decoded (since the token was undeclared).</para>

		<para>It is recommended that &disp; is invoked via &tcc; using the
			<option>-disp</option> or the <option>-disp_t</option> option.
			The <option>-opt</option> flag can be passed to &disp; by passing
			the flag <option>-W</option><literal>d,-</literal><replaceable>opt</replaceable> to
			&tcc;.</para>

		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>&g.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; print any diagnostic information units
						within the &tdf; capsule.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&n.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; try to format its output to fit into a
						page width of &cols.arg;.
						The default page width is <literal>80</literal>.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&q.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; ignore the specified page width and
						print its output with the minimum possible indentation.
						This makes it run faster, but does not make the best use
						of the available page width.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&r.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; continue after any errors.
						The use of this flag is not recommended since anything read
						after an error is likely to be of very little
						value.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&v.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; print its version number and the version
						of the &tdf; specification it supports.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&A.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; decode all the units it recognises
						(including diagnostic and linking units) within the &tdf;
						capsule.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&D.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; print a simple binary dump of the input
						file. This is intended for debugging purposes.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&E.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; report such information as the number of
						external tags and tokens which it usually omits.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&S.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Because tokens may be defined in terms of other
						tokens and do not need to be declared before they are
						defined, &disp; makes two passes of all the token
						definition units.
						In the first pass it extracts only the declaration
						information, stepping over the main body of the
						definition.
						On the second pass all the information is read.</para>

					<para>The &S.opt; option makes &disp; skip the first
						pass.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&T.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>The skip pass described under the &S.opt; option is
						usually done silently, without printing any information.
						This is changed by the &T.opt; option, which causes output
						to be printed.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&U.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; print the usage information associated
						with the external tokens and tags and also any linkage
						information units within the capsule.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&V.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>By default &disp; attempts to rationalise the &tdf;
						it reads.
						In particular it uses the external token and tag names
						whenever possible, following the token and tag bindings
						to find these, and makes up names for those tokens and
						tags which do not have external names.</para>

					<para>The &V.opt; option makes it not attempt any such
						rationalisation, but instead to output exactly what it
						reads.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>&W.opt;</term>

				<listitem>
					<para>Makes &disp; issue a warning about every token which
						is used before it is declared.</para>

		<title>Diagnostics</title>

		<para>The error reports if the input file is not a legal &tdf; capsule
			are intended to aid developers writing programs which produce &tdf;.
			Thus they try to give all the information that may be required,
			including the position within the input file at which the error
			occurred.</para>
